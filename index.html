<p>June 2016 - Present <br>
<strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> Intern with <em>Mozilla Research</em> on <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo Project</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My project involves implementing a new Web platform specification called Service Workers in Servo, a parallel browser engine being developed in Rust, a type safe language by Mozilla, to build a safe, fast and modern browser engine. Service workers feature in Servo will enable a new breed of offline web apps, such as fall back off-line content, push notifications, background sync etc. <a href="https://github.com/creativcoder/gsoc16">Details</a></p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>Projects mentioned here were made out of my own curiosity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CodinCloud</strong> [WIP] is a compiler as a service platform prototype written using python flask framework as the backend service and MaterializeCSS on the frontend. The idea is to have a platform similar to cloud9 ide. A demo of the site is available at <a href="https://flaskcompiler.herokuapp.com">heroku</a>. <a href="https://github.com/creativcoder/CodinCloud">Github</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>Meltdown</strong> [WIP] is a download manager written in Rust. Splits the task given to it in fixed sized chunks and downloads them in parallel. Uses Rust’s message passing <a href="https://github.com/servo/ipc-channel">Channels</a> api for inter-thread communication. <br>
  As of now has a rudimentary UI integration using <a href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk">gtk-rs</a> framework and does not have a resume support, which i intend to integrate in next alpha release when time permits. <a href="https://github.com/meltdown-rs">Github</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>Silica</strong> [WIP] is a static site generator written in Rust. The site uses the doc-opt command line argument parser in rust and supports writing content in markdown and renders them to html. A custom template engine is in progress for next alpha release. <a href="https://github.com/creativcoder/silica">Github</a></p>
